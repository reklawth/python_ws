    "Caution, when keeping references to the `traceback` object: always render the output needed from a traceback object within the dynamic scope of the `except` block.  That is, do not sotre a `traceback` - or indeed exception - object for later use.  This is because the `traceback` object contains regerences to all the stack frame objects which comprise the call stack, and each stack frame contains references to all of its local varia bles.  As such, the size of the transitive closure of objects reachable form tthe `traceback` object can be very large, and if you maintain that regerence these objects will not be garbage collected.  Prefer to render tracebacks into another form for even short-term storage in memory."
