    "Implicit chaining occurs when one exception occurs whilst another is being processed.  The Python runtime amchinery associates the original exception with the new exception by setting the special `__context__` attribute of the most recent exception.  Demonstrate this by adding a main() function which contains two bugs to the triangle area program.  The first bug is the attempt to evaluate the area of a non-triangle with sides 3, 4, and 10.  The second bug is that in the process of handling the resulting `TriangleException` an `io.UnsupportedOperation` exception occurs by trying to print to the read-only `stdin` stream instead of the `stderr` stream."
