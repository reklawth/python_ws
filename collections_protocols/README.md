# Implementing Collections with Protocols

- The _container_ protocol, which allows for testing for item membership in a collection
- The _sized_ protocol, which allows for determining the number of items in a collection
- The _iterable_ protocol which yield the items in the collection one by one.
- The _sequence_ protocol which supports random read access to collections.
- The _set_ protocol which support various set operations such as set-intersection.
