# Class Scope Attributes

Class attributes are shared betwen all instances of a class

Class attributes can be referred to either within the class definition or without the class definition by fully qualifying them with the class name

Refrain from attempting to assign to class attributes through the self instance, this will actually create a new instance attribute.
